Getting Started
===============
The basics of LootTweaker are more complicated than the basics of CraftTweaker, and most other CraftTweaker addons. This is unavoidable, designing LootTweaker to be used more like most CraftTweaker addons would have made it very verbose and rather ugly. Additionally Minecraft's loot system is complicated. I have tried to minimise the knowledge required to use the basics, but you will have to learn a few new concepts if you haven't gone beyond the basics of CraftTweaker before.  
All of the required concepts are covered either in the resources linked in the Essential Reading section, or in the :doc:`Tutorials<tutorials/tutorial-index>`.

Assumed Knowledge
-----------------
These docs will assume that you:

* Are familiar with the basics of ZenScript (The language used for CraftTweaker scripts).
* Understand what tables, pools, entries, conditions, and functions are in the context of Minecraft's loot system. A complete in-depth understanding is not expected.


Essential Reading
-----------------
* `The basics of variables <http://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Vanilla/Variable_Types/Variable_Types/>`_
* `The MC wiki article on Loot Tables <https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table>`_. Note that Forge does make some changes to the format, which are detailed :doc:`here<reference/forge-loot-table-format>`.
