**What does deprecated mean?**  
Sometimes I discover better ways of doing things that require me to change how the methods and classes I expose to ZenScript are used. To avoid breaking scripts, I leave the old methods in and add new methods that do things the new, better way. However the use of the old methods is discouraged, they are undocumented, unsupported, and LootTweaker will warn you if you use them. Eventually the old methods will be removed, but until then there is a period where both work, allowing you to transition when you want to. This is called deprecation.

**Note:** Deprecation warnings can be disabled in LootTweaker's config. The config option will reset if you change the installed version of LootTweaker.

Below is a list of all the deprecated methods. It explains why they were deprecated, what their replacement is, when they were deprecated, and when they will be removed.

|Deprecated Method|Reason|Replacement|Deprecated as of|Will be removed in|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|`Functions.parse(String json)`|Using strings to take JSON input has issues with nested quotes. Using IData avoids this problem.|`Functions.parse(IData json)`|0.0.7|Closest release to 20th May 2018|

|`LootPool#removeItemEntry(IItemStack stack)`|Has no benefits over `LootPool#removeEntry(String name)`. `removeEntry("minecraft:potato")` is equivalent to `removeItemEntry(<minecraft:potato>)`.
