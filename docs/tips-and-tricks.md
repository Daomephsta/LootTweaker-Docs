**Setting NBT, metadata and quantity**  
All LootTweaker methods that take an `IItemStack` will attempt to keep the metadata, NBT tag, and stacksize of the passed `IItemStack`. This is done by automatically generating *set_damage*, *set_data* and *set_count* functions. A function will not be auto-generated for a loot entry if the entry already has a function of the same type. This means that
`pool.addItemEntry(<minecraft:apple * 2>, 1);` is equivalent to `pool.addItemEntryHelper(<minecraft:apple>, 1, 1, [Functions.setCount(2, 2)], []);`
