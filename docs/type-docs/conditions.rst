Conditions
==========

:full name: ``loottweaker.vanilla.loot.Conditions``

JSON can be verbose and difficult to write. This type can help.
It provides methods for creating simple loot conditions, but if you wish to use complex loot conditions you still have to write them in JSON.
``minecraft:entity_properties`` and ``minecraft:entity_scores`` do not have helper methods as they are too complex.

All methods on this page, except ``parse()`` create a vanilla loot condition, so their parameters are equivalent to the parameters of the equivalent loot condition.
All vanilla loot conditions are listed and documented `here <https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Loot_table#Conditions>`_.

The corresponding type for loot functions is :doc:`functions`.
